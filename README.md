## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project was to present data to a key stakeholder, so they could see for themselves, if a bike rental service would be profitable for Des Moines.  The data collected, cleaned, and presented, was from NYC Citibike for August of 2019.  For this analysis, Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Pandas were used to change the tripduration column datatype from integer to datetime.  After creating a new csv with the changed datatype column; charts, graphs, and heatmaps were generated in Tableau and then uploaded to the Tableau server (link to Tableau project at top of page).

### Resources
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Python
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv ("https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html")


## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of subscribers is far greater than the number of  customers.  This suggests locals account for most of Citibike's revenue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heatmap shows most of the rentals occur during peak commute hours for work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heatmap shows that males account for most of the peak commute hours for work.

<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When selecting subscribers from the Usertype option you can clearly see males are the dominant Citibike Subscriber.  Most likely they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the services to get back and forth to work.

### Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that male local subscribers are the driving force of the success of Citibike in New York City.  New York City is a very congested city compaired to Des Moines.  Also, public transportation is a huge strength in NYC from trains to taxis and buses.  For a successful start up in Des Moines there are probably quite a few more factors to consider.  Two additonal suggestions to analyze from this data would be: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*average age of subscribers vs customers
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*average distance traveled by gender

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two suggestions would help break down the city demographics and why a business that thrives in NYC may or may not thrive in Des Moines.  Judging from this data, it would be a great idea to do surveys on the amount of locals who would be interested in a bike rental service.  Des Moines is much less dense than NYC so commutes to work and back could be much longer in comparison.  This data provides a solid start to researching the successful probability of a Citibike in Des Moines but more data and analysis is recommended.
